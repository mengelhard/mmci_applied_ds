# Applied Data Science Final Project
**Due Dates**
- *Proposal:* 7:59am ET on the first day of the third course weekend
- *Report and Presentation:* 7:59am on the first day of the final course weekend

## Team Assignment: 
Propose a data science research project related to a clinical topic of your choosing. Your project should use techniques from at least one of the topics discussed in class (e.g. multilayer perceptron, computer vision, natural language processing, time-series modeling, reinforcement learning). Deliverables will include an initial project proposal, which must be approved by the instructor; a final report, formatted as a brief research proposal/grant; and a short (15-minute) presentation.

## Background and Significance (1 page): 
Describe the clinical problem, its importance, and the need for the data science approach you are proposing. This should include a brief literature review (>10 scientific articles) establishing the significance of the problem and identifying prior statistical models, if they exist. What recent innovations or developments have made this approach possible? These might relate to new data resources, new data science techniques, or new clinical insights.

## Objective(s) (<.5 pages):
Briefly describe the objectives of your project. If you are developing a predictive model, this should include the type of model, its inputs and outputs, performance metrics, and a hypothesis (or hypotheses) to be evaluated.

## Approach (2-3 pages):
Describe the steps that would be taken to carry out your project, including the following:
- Data acquisition. Your project can use an existing data source or propose a new data collection. If you propose a new study, please describe its design as briefly as possible and focus on the resulting data.
- Data preprocessing. Describe any initial processing that would be conducted prior to modeling.
- Model development. Describe your proposed model and outline steps required to develop it. If you will be using or modifying a previously-developed architecture, please cite it.
- Model training and evaluation. Provide a training and evaluation plan based on (a) cross-validation or (b) a fixed data partition, as appropriate. Justify your choice. If a tuning set is needed, describe how it will be used. List all performance metrics and describe how your hypothesis(-es) will be evaluated.

## Presentation (15 minutes):
Each group will give a 15-minute presentation followed by 5 minutes of Q&A on the last day of class. The presentation should include approximately 5 minutes of background, a brief description of objectives, and approximately 10 minutes describing the approach, with emphasis on model development and evaluation. 

## Grading:
