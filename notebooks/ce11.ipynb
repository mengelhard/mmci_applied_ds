    "# Computational Exercise 11: Human Activity Recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll be working with the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones), which is exactly what it sounds like. As described on [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) site:\n",
    "- Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years\n",
    "- Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist\n",
    "- 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz with the phone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope\n",
    "- The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data\n",
    "\n",
    "For each record, we have:\n",
    "- Triaxial (i.e. x-, y-, and z-direction) acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration\n",
    "- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope\n",
    "- A label indicating the corresponding activity\n",
    "- There is also a 561-feature vector with extracted time and frequency domain variables, but we will not be using it in this exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Describe and visualize the dataset\n",
    "- Extract summary statistics for each record\n",
    "- Predict activities using the extracted summary statistics\n",
    "- Predict activities by applying a simple RNN to the raw data (i.e. without extracting summary statistics)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by importing the usual libraries including `tensorflow`, which we'll use to create and train the RNN."
