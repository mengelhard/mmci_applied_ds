    "# Computational Exercise 3: Predicting malignancy from features of breast cancer samples\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this assignment, we'll develop models that predict malignancy in the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnosis Dataset][1] we explored last time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, please note that there are a number of resources related to this dataset, including the following:\n",
    "- [discussion and examples on kaggle][2]\n",
    "- [Medium article similar to this assignment][3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Continue to gain familiarity with Python and the Jupyter notebook format\n",
    "- See how to prepare a simple, modeling-friendly dataset for model development\n",
    "- See how to train and evaluate logistic regression and multilayer perceptron models can be trained and evaluated in `sklearn`\n",
    "- Begin to interpret and contextualize model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of our computational assignments will begin by importing a few required libraries using an `import` statement. These libraries extend the basic functionality of Python. By importing `as X` (e.g. `as np`), we can shorten subsequent calls to the library in our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numpy` for efficient math operations\n",
    "- `pandas` for dataframes and dataframe operations\n",
    "- `matplotlib` for visualization/plotting\n",
    "- `sklearn` gives us a convenient way to load our dataset, as before, but this time we'll also use it to develop our models! The vast majority of \"standard\" machine learning models are implemented in this library. When working with specific neural network architectures, on the other hand -- this includes convolutional and recurrent neural networks -- we'll need to use a more customizable machine learning library like `tensorflow` or `pytorch`.\n",

    "As in assignment 1, we'll use `sklearn` to load the dataset. Typically you might load from `.csv` with `pd.read_csv()`, from `.xlsx` with `pd.read_excel()`, etc., but the result would be the same: you'd end up with a `pandas` dataframe. In this case, `sklearn` gives us a nice way to load this dataframe without having to find and download a `.csv` file on our own.\n",

    "Since we explored this dataset in our previous assignment, we can now take a few more simple steps to prepare it for model development. First, note that there are 569 patients in our dataset. We can determine this by adding the value counts for y, or with `len(df)`. To keep things simple, let's **use the first 400 samples (i.e. rows) to *train* our models, and the remaining 169 to *test* it**. We will *not* be defining a validation set in this exercise. Later on, we'll be using a validation set to select a best model or tune hyperparameters, but we don't need to worry about this just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step prior to modeling will be to *standardize* our data by shifting it so that the mean is 0, then scaling it so that the standard deviation is 1. This step will make our model coefficients more interpretable and keep them all in the same range; the latter is particularly important for neural networks, and for models in which large coefficients are penalized.\n",

All information about the model and its parameters is stored within the object. See [the documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) for further details.\n",

We'll also specify that model parameters should not be penalized in any way by passing `penalty='none'`, and ensure the model has suffient time to finish training by passing `max_iter=10000`.\n",
    "- In the second line, we will use the `.fit()` method on our model object to fit the model to our training set. In other words, this very short line does all the work of actually training the model. For more complex models, this line may take some time to run.\n",
    "- In the third line, we predict the *probability* that `y` is 1 for each of the samples in our test set. By default, `sklearn` returns two columns corresponding to the predicted probability that y is 0 and 1, respectively. We only need the latter, so we'll select this column with `[:, 1]`.\n",
    "- In the fourth line, we predict the *value* of `y` based on this probability. Specifically, we'll predict that `y` is 1 whenever the predicted probability is greater than 0.5, otherwise we'll predict that `y` is 0. Using 0.5 as our threshold is not always the best idea, but it'll work for now.\n",
